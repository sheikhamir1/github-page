        <h2>Git and GitHub: An Overview</h2>
        <h4>Git:</h4>
        <p>
          Git is a version control system (VCS) that helps developers manage and
          track changes to files and code over time. It is widely used in
          software development to maintain the history of changes, collaborate
          with team members, and ensure the integrity and consistency of a
          project. Git allows you to keep track of all the modifications made to
          your codebase, revert to previous versions when needed, and manage
          parallel development efforts.
        </p>
        <h4>Core Features of Git:</h4>
        <p>
          Version Control: Git allows you to save snapshots of your code at
          different points in time. Each snapshot is called a commit. Branching
          and Merging: You can create branches to work on different features or
          fixes independently. Once you're done, you can merge the branch back
          into the main project. Distributed: Unlike centralized version control
          systems (like SVN), Git is distributed. This means that each developer
          has their own local copy of the entire repository, including its
          history. Collaboration: Git allows multiple developers to work on the
          same project at the same time, merging their changes seamlessly.
        </p>
        <h4>Basic Git Commands:</h4>
        <p>
          git init – Initializes a new Git repository in your project. git add
          file – Stages a file, marking it for inclusion in the next commit. git
          commit -m "message" – Creates a commit with the changes you've staged.
          git status – Shows the current status of your working directory (which
          files are staged, which are modified, etc.). git log – Displays the
          commit history of the repository. git branch – Lists all branches in
          the repository. git checkout branch – Switches to a specific branch.
          git merge branch – Merges the changes from the specified branch into
          the current branch.
